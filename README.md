BladeJs
=======

BladeJS is a small JavaScript library which attempts to make interactive AJAX communication via jQuery easier for developers. The main goal of the project is to reduce the amount of JavaScript code needed to write responsive applications. BladeJS provides a generalized approach which allows developers to provide arguments/data within HTML markup by way of HTML5 data attributes. This helps to limit the amount of common JavaScript code needed to make these communications possible.
